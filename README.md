# This calculator simulates the iPhone calc, but it is a little different

In this calculator, if there are two numbers (A and B) and only one (A) has a
percent sign, that one will be converted to a percentage of the other number.
Then the calculation will be performed with the new calculated percentage and
the non-percent number. A% + B = (A / 100 \* B) + B

If both numbers have % signs, they will be calculated as regular numbers and the
result will have a % sign (the % sign is not currently displayed).
